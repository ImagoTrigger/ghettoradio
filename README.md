# Software for ghettoradio.us

Yes, it's still around! http://ghettoradio.us :metro: :wc:

Use this media player: https://www.foobar2000.org/ (for accurate meta tag timing)

Listen to the software demo stream here: http://ghettoradio.us:8000/listen.pls?sid=2 
Stereo speakers/headphones recommended (goes "split-stream" during busy moments).
Don't forget to open with Foobar2000 so you can read who is talking! (winamp and the like seem to lag behind).
